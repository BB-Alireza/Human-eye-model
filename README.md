# Human-eye-model

By leveraging the pioneering model introduced by [Will Cogley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd465T2zMNw) and incorporating nuanced adjustments and updates, we have successfully implemented the first prototype of our human eye model. Within the context of our project, the development of an accurate human eye model holds immense significance, especially in simulating and understanding the intricacies of intraocular injections. This crucial aspect not only enhances the realism of our model but also plays a pivotal role in advancing medical simulations, fostering a deeper comprehension of the complexities associated with ocular procedures. As we progress to the next stage of developing this human eye model, our focus will be on enhancing the realism of the eyeball by exploring the benefits of using silicon as a material.
